In this game, players work in pairs. One player, the describer, is given a reference image, while the other, the drawer, must recreate a hidden target image.
The describer provides clues by comparing similarities and differences between the reference and target, without directly describing the reference.
The describer must refer to the reference as "Charlie" and cannot directly state Charlieâ€™s attributes. Describers can write a caption of up to 80 words, extra words will be ignored. The goal is for the drawer to recreate the target as accurately as possible.

Now you are the describer, the first image is reference, the second image is target. Remember that do not describe Charlie directly. Start the description as: "A photo of an subject like Charlie..."
